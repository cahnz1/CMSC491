Got everything done up until the sobel shader code.  It all works.  I wrote the  sobel code, but for some reason it is not defining the PostProcessInput1.  I cleaned up all of the code that I thought was unnesscary.  Thank you for a great semester. 

Everything as been named With the word My in the title.  Ex. MyPostProcessPass, CVar, MyCvar, etc.
